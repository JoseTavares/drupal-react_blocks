> ** VIRTUAL DOM **
React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server using Node.js â€” no heavy browser DOM required.


Here, these are the [ReactJS Docs](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)

This also relies on the [React](http://drupal.org/project/react) module to serve the library.

To use the JSX syntax do this:

    npm install -g react-tools


    jsx --watch src/ build/

Otherwise you can edit the build/ directly and delete src to add your own react components.
